  <h3>...by hosting a coderetreat in your city.</h3>
  <p>
  Hosts handle all of the logistics of organizing, finding a local sponsor,
  running a coderetreat and creating an atmosphere of fun and collaboration.
  </p> <p>
  To host a coderetreat:
  <ul>
    <li>Pick a date and time to hold your coderetreat. Coderetreats lasts for a day (9:00am-5:00pm). Because of this, coderetreats are usually held on a Saturday.</li>
    <li>Find a place to hold your coderetreat. Many local tech companies are willing to serve as a venue.</li>
    <li>Find one ore more local sponsors for lunch and other expenses. Coderetreats must be free.</lI>
    <li>Recruite a facilitator to guide the participants through the day.</li>
    <li>Arrange for a nice, catered lunch. If participatns who are willing to come out at 9 in the morning to spend the day coding deserve more than just pizza for lunch.</li>
  </ul>
