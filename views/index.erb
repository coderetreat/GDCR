      Coderetreats are run by volunteers who want to help out
      their local developer community.
      Hosts handle all of the logistics,
      and facilitators guide participants through the exercises.
      </p> <p>
      Coderetreats are easy to organize and facilitate.  Most of all, they are a lot of fun and a great way
      to meet other developers in your area!
      </p> <p>
